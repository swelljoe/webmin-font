Icon font for Webmin related icons

In order to simplify use of Webmin logos in new themes, modules, websites, etc. I made an icon font for the Webmin, Virtualmin, and Cloudmin logos.

These icons are free to use in both Open Source and commercial projects, though trademark usage guidelines still apply. If you're in doubt about whether you can use them, get in touch. Generally, as long as your use does not cause confusion or imply endorsement by Virtualmin, Inc. or the Webmin project of your site or software, it should be fine.

Usage is like any other icon font. In short:

  * Include the style.css
  * Reference the icons with the name, i.e. class="wbm-virtualmin"
  * Style them as you would any other CSS element with colors, sizing, etc.

The initial font was created with fontastic.me, which is a great free tool for generating font icons.
